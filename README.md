# Play Tic-Tac-Toe against a neural net!

First train the model with:
```sh
$ python training.py
```

The training can be interrupted at any time with Ctrl+C, also it stops itself after some time when the loss stops decreasing much.

Play against the trained model with:
```sh
$ python play.py
```

Note: There is no RL used. This is purely based on 'memorization' of move values.
